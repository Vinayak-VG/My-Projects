# Character-Level CNN for Text Classification

## Advantages 

  * No Text Processing
  * Good Handling of misspelled words/out of vocabulary words
  * Fast Training

Since it is character based and not word based, we don't need any text processing like Glove or Word2Vec. It also handles misspelled words or Unknown words
