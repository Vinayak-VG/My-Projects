# My-Projects

This GitHub Repository is the collection of all the Machine Learning and Deep Learning Projects I have worked on

## Computer Vision Projects: 
  * 2D Image Segmentation
    * [U-Net Image Segmentation](https://github.com/Vinayak-VG/My-Projects/tree/main/Computer_Vision_Projects/2D_Image_Segmentation/U-Net_Image_Segmentation)
      * [U-Net](https://github.com/Vinayak-VG/My-Projects/tree/main/Computer_Vision_Projects/2D_Image_Segmentation/U-Net_Image_Segmentation/U-Net)
      * [U-Net++](https://github.com/Vinayak-VG/My-Projects/tree/main/Computer_Vision_Projects/2D_Image_Segmentation/U-Net_Image_Segmentation/U-Net%2B%2B)
  * 3D Semantic Segmentation
    * [PointNet](https://github.com/Vinayak-VG/My-Projects/tree/main/Computer_Vision_Projects/3D_Semantic_Segmentation/PointNet)
  * Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN)
    * [DCGAN](https://github.com/Vinayak-VG/My-Projects/tree/main/Computer_Vision_Projects/Generative_Adversarial_Networks-GAN/DCGAN)
    * [StackGAN](https://github.com/Vinayak-VG/My-Projects/tree/main/Computer_Vision_Projects/Generative_Adversarial_Networks-GAN/StackGAN)

## Natural Language Processing Projects:
  * Text Classification
    * [KimCNN](https://github.com/Vinayak-VG/My-Projects/tree/main/Natural_Language_Processing/Text_Classification/KimCNN)
    * [CharacterCNN](https://github.com/Vinayak-VG/My-Projects/tree/main/Natural_Language_Processing/Text_Classification/CharacterCNN)     

## What's New
### 8th July
  
  * Pushed KimCNN and CharacterCNN under NLP
  * Pushed DCGAN code with markdown
  * Started working on StackGAN

### 3rd July 
  
  * Started PointNet, and added the summary for the paper

### 29th June

  * Added U-Net and U-Net++ Summary

### 1st June

  * Pushed the first code in the My-Projects GitHub Repo (U-Net is my first project)  
  * Properly documented the code and the datasets for U-Net and U-Net++ and wrote the Readme File
