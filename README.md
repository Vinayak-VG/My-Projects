# My-Projects

This GitHub Repository is the collection of all the Machine Learning and Deep Learning Projects I have worked on

## Computer Vision Projects: 
  * 2D Image Segmentation

      * [U-Net](https://github.com/Vinayak-VG/My-Projects/tree/main/Computer%20Vision%20Projects/2D%20Image%20Segmentation/U-Net%20Image%20Segmentation/U-Net)
      * [U-Net++](https://github.com/Vinayak-VG/My-Projects/tree/main/Computer%20Vision%20Projects/2D%20Image%20Segmentation/U-Net%20Image%20Segmentation/U-Net%2B%2B)
  * 3D Semantic Segmentation
    * [PointNet](https://github.com/Vinayak-VG/My-Projects/tree/main/Computer%20Vision%20Projects/3D%20Semantic%20Segmentation/PointNet)
  * Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN)
    * [DCGAN](https://github.com/Vinayak-VG/My-Projects/tree/main/Computer%20Vision%20Projects/Generative%20Adversarial%20Networks%20-%20GAN/DCGAN)

## Natural Language Processing Projects:
  * Text Classification
    * [KimCNN](https://github.com/Vinayak-VG/My-Projects/tree/main/Natural%20Language%20Processing/Text%20Classification/KimCNN)
    * [CharacterCNN](https://github.com/Vinayak-VG/My-Projects/tree/main/Natural%20Language%20Processing/Text%20Classification/CharacterCNN)     

## What's New
### 8th July
