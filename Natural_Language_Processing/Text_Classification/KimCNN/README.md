# KimCNN for Sentence Classification

Disadvantage of LSTMs and RNNs are that they are very slow because the data is feeded sequentially. Hence we are not making the correct use of GPU.
To solve this issue, they introduce KimCNN. This model architecture uses Convolutional Neural Networks in NLP. The feed the data parallely so it is much faster.
